#This is the code book for the project

First, download data from the link provided and unzip it into working directory of R Studio.
Then, Execute the R script.

The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
Details can be acessed from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

About R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" performs the steps in the course website:

Reading in the files and merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
I. Read files
a. Read the trainings tables
b. Then testing tables
c. Then feature vector
d. Next activity labels
II Assigning names to variables
III Merging all data into one dataset
TV. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and SD
V. Reading variable names
VI. Create vector for defining ID, mean and SD
VII. Making nessesary subset from merged data set
VIII. Name the activities in the data set with descriptive activity
IX. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
X. Creating another data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
XII. Making second tidy dataset
XIII. Writing second tidy data et in txt file
XIV. The code assumes all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

Information regarding the variables listed below:
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test, features, activityLabels contain the data from the downloaded files.
x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
features - names for the x_data dataset to be applied to the column names stored in
